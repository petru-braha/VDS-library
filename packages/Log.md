test fixture - with all the test necessary
how to test the defined errors?????

1. test all constructors
- default, copy, move
- list
- block

2. default blocks and lists

3. for simplicity i will consider a standard size for all my blocks of memory and lists. let's choose a number:
- small enough to not make 
- we need negative values, positive values, neutral values(e. g. NULL, 0), repeating values, very large and very small values
- the goal is to test the data structure's behavior and not the values themselves -> the blocks and the lists contain the same values 



- primitives executes 4 times
- convoluted executes 4 times
- an array_evaluation interface
- an array_evaluation

- let the user test himself some values for an data structure
- runs only one test suite ::testing::GTEST_FLAG(filter) = "*Counter*:*IsPrime*:*ListenersTest.DoesNotLeak*";//":-:*Counter*";

each comparing function return true if the elements have to be changed



actual design

// execution direct from the terminal
// data structure // 10 values + display construction
// tests
// after testing 
// give the oportunity to insert delete and stop //
