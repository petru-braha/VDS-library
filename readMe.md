# Visual data structures

## Goal:
- to apply and understand the theory learned
- to learn GLFW and to display the result in an intuitive way
- the focus of my study does not imply the development of containers and adaptors 

## List of the data structures in my project:
1. array
2. linked_list
3. stack, queue
4. maxheap, minheap
5. tree, AVL, red_black_tree, trie
6. graph, collection()
7. hash-map(chaining, open-addressing)
*  trivial_tree

## Technologies used:
- C/C++
- GTEST
- OPENGL
- GLFW library

- my documentation regarding the design of this project is all based on: "Introduction to Algorithms" 4th by Leiserson, Stein, Rivest, Cormen

### TO DO:
- build trivial_tree, minheap, sorting algorithms 
- correct my log text

- design header files
- design logically all the structures needed
- use GLFW to display simple outputs of the operations

### Notes:
- SOLID principles are respected
- current set-up: ISO C++14 Standard, VS 2022 version 17.10.4, GLFW 3.4
