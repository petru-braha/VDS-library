# Visual data structures

## Goal:
- to apply and understand the theory learned
- to learn GLFW and to display the result in an intuitive way
- to actually have my own implemented library of utilities

## List of the data structures in my project:
1. array
2. linked list
3. stack, queue
4. maxheap, minheap
5. tree, AVL tree, red black tree, trie
6. graph, collection
7. map

## Technologies used:
- C/C++
- GTEST
- OPENGL
- GLFW library

### Notes:
- read the md files in the following order:
	1. README
	2. wiki
	3. log
- the focus of my study does not imply the development of containers and adaptors 
- my documentation is from: "Introduction to Algorithms" 4th by Leiserson, Stein, Rivest and Cormen
- S.O.L.I.D. principles are respected
- current set-up: ISO C++17 Standard, VS 2022 version 17.10.4, GLFW 3.4 (see more on the wiki page)
