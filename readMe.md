# Visual data structures

## Motivation 
- this repository is intended to be used as a replica of C++ STL. Its advantage over C++ STL is the drawing feature. Using VSA library gives the oportunity for any to display results in a intuitive way such that begginers can manipulate and learn about studied data structures.
- to make use of the theory in practice and create pedagogical exemples for any new students of computer science. 

## Technologies used
- C/C++
- GTEST
- OPENGL
- GLFW
- GLAD
