# Visual data structures

## Purpose:
1. to apply and understand the theory learned
2. to learn GLFW and to display the result in an intuitive way
3. the focus of my study does not imply the development of containers and adaptors 
*  my work, conceptually, is independent of the language, even though profit exists based on C++'s advantages

## List of the data structures in my project:
1. array
2. linked_list
3. stack, queue
4. maxheap, minheap
5. tree, AVL, red-black tree, trie
6. graph, disjoint set collection
7. hash-map, by chaining, by reduce collisions

## Technologies used:
- C/C++
- GTEST
- OPENGL
- GLFW library

- my documentation regarding the design of this project is all based on: "Introduction to Algorithms" 4th by Leiserson, Stein, Rivest, Cormen

### TO DO:
- operator =, == for stack and queue implement node_tree, print method should be more general!!!
- dfs
- to develop a way of interationing between structures (of not the same type)
- design logically all the structures needed
- use glfw to display simple outputs of the operations

### Notes:
- SOLID principles are respected
- current set-up: Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10.4 and GLFW 3.4
