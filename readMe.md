# Visual data structures

## Goal:
- to apply and understand the theory learned
- to learn GLFW and to display the result in an intuitive way
- to actually have my own implemented library of utilities

## List of the data structures in my project:
0. array
1. hash table
2. linked list
3. stack
4. queue
5. maxheap
6. minheap
7. trivial tree
8. AVL tree
9. red black tree
0. trie
1. graph
2. map
*  collection

## Technologies used:
- C/C++
- GTEST
- OPENGL
- GLFW library

### Notes:
- please consult the wiki pages 
- the focus of my study does not imply the development of containers and adaptors
- my documentation is from: "Introduction to Algorithms" 4th by Leiserson, Stein, Rivest and Cormen
- current set-up: ISO C++17 Standard, VS 2022 version 17.10.4, GLFW 3.4
