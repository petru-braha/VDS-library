# Visual data structures

## Goal
- to apply and understand the theory learned
- to learn GLFW and to display the result in an intuitive way
- to actually have my own implemented library of utilities

## Technologies used
- C/C++
- GTEST
- OPENGL
- GLFW library

## Data structures list
0. array
1. linked list
2. stack
3. queue
4. AVL tree
5. red black tree
6. maxheap
7. minheap
8. graph
9. hash table

## Notes
- please consult the wiki pages 
- !set-up: C++17 Standard, VS 2022 version 17.10.6 (the latest release crash my code), GLFW 3.4
