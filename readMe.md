# Data structures

## Purpose:
1. to apply and understand the theory learned 
2. to learn GLFW and to display the result in an intuitive way

## List of the data structures in my project:
1. array
2. node
3. list
3. tree, binary tree, complete binary tree, binary search tree, AVL, red black tree, MAX heap, tries
4. graph, disjoint set collections
5. hash map, by chaining, by reduce collisions
6. adaptors: stack, queue

## Technologies used:
- C/C++
- GTEST
- OPENGL (GLFW library)

- my documentation regarding the design of this project is all based on: "Introduction to Algorithms" 4th by Leiserson, Stein, Rivest, Cormen

### plan:
- to develop a way of interationing between structures
1. design logically all the structures needed
2. use glfw to display simple outputs of the operations
