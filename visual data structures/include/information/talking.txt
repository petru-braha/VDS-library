what is a data structure:
is array hash-table map or dictionaries data structures?
concept actual c++ implementation


array errors:
```
method		error type	message
shift_left 	fatal_error 	"nothing to shift"
constructor	fatal_error	"wrong parameters"

insert		hard_error	"bad index"
insert 		fatal_error	"no more memory"
remove 		hard_error	"bad index"
queries 	hard_error	"no data"
operator[]	hard_error  	"unallocated space"

```

- interfaces can not contain data members - except tree - i won't modify it
- currently in my project there are two types of non-instantiable classes:
- interfaces
- private constructors classes: lists

to do: 
0. linked_list sort
1. continue with tree and never come back

- ordering operations - to be tested in covoluted
- data structures should be independent of the base type that it stores. there is just one part of the implementation that requires more analysis: ordering of the elements. the ordering problem is based on sorting and comparisons. the convoluted types should be tested when it comes to this problem, testing them with insertions is redundant;
